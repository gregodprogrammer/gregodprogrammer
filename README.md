Linux systems • DevOps fundamentals • Open-source learning



## About

I am building practical skills in Linux systems and DevOps with a strong interest
in support engineering and open-source technologies.

My IT learning journey started over three years ago. I focus on hands-on labs,
manual configuration, and documentation to understand how systems behave in
real environments.



## Current Focus

- Ubuntu Linux administration (WSL and virtual machines)
- Git and GitHub workflows
- Virtualization using VirtualBox
- DevOps and cloud fundamentals
- Basic networking and troubleshooting
- Security fundamentals

## How I Work

I prefer typing commands manually when learning so I can understand system behavior
and failure modes.

I document steps and observations, especially when something does not work as
expected. Troubleshooting is part of my learning process.

I focus on building strong fundamentals and improving through regular practice.
